# what is web scraping?

Web scraping is the process of automatically collecting data from websites.
Instead of copying information manually, a computer program (often written in Python using tools like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium) visits web pages, reads their HTML code, and extracts the parts you need â€” for example, names, prices, articles, or tables.
Web scraping = using code to fetch and extract specific data from the web.
